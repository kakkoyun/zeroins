## ⚠️ UPDATED — Convergence Story (supersedes prior "NOT donated" correction)

**The correct framing (verified 2026-08-10, otelc research agent):**

DataDog and Alibaba both proposed donations to OpenTelemetry in early 2025. Neither was
accepted as-is. Instead, both orgs joined forces to **bootstrap a new OTel SIG** and build
`otelc` from scratch — a unified, vendor-neutral codebase picking the best of both approaches.

> Source: <https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/go-compile-time-instrumentation/>

Orchestrion **remains actively maintained** as a standalone Datadog project. Its README makes
no mention of donation or deprecation. otelc is the OTel SIG output (v1.0.1, first stable).

**For the talk:** say "One story converging" — otelc is where the ecosystem lands. Orchestrion
is the more mature input and remains the Datadog-specific option.

| | DataDog/orchestrion | open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CLI binary** | `orchestrion` | `otelc` |
| **Repo** | github.com/DataDog/orchestrion | github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation |
| **Owner** | Datadog (active standalone) | OTel SIG (Datadog + Alibaba joint) |
| **Status** | GA v1.11.0 (2026-06-25) | Stable v1.0.1 (2026-07-14) |
| **Default tracer** | dd-trace-go/v2 (but vendor-agnostic) | OpenTelemetry SDK |
| **Relationship** | Inspiration + SIG co-founder | New tool built from scratch |

The talk uses `otelc` (the OTel SIG tool). Orchestrion is relevant as the inspiration and for the
`dd-trace-go` integration count. Both use the same core mechanism.

## 1. Provenance & Project Status

Datadog and Alibaba were independently building compile-time Go instrumentation tools and converged.
They co-founded the **OTel Go Compile-Time Instrumentation SIG** and built `otelc` from scratch —
*"a new next generation of an OpenTelemetry-standard tool inspired by Orchestrion."*

- **DataDog/orchestrion**: Datadog's own tool, vendor-agnostic but defaults to dd-trace-go/v2.
  GA since v1.0.0 (2024-11-26). Current: **v1.11.0 (2026-06-25)**. Repo: `github.com/DataDog/orchestrion`.
- **open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation** (`otelc`): OTel SIG tool.
  First non-retracted stable: **v1.0.1 (2026-07-14)**. Repo: `github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation`.
  Pinned install: `go install go.opentelemetry.io/otelc/tool/cmd/otelc@v1.0.1`

## 2. How It Works: The Core Mechanism (both tools)

Both tools use the same mechanism, which Orchestrion's maintainers describe as **"compile-time-woven
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AoP)"**:

1. **`-toolexec` proxy**: The tool registers as a Go toolchain proxy via Go's `-toolexec` flag.
   Every invocation of `go tool compile` is intercepted before it runs.
2. **AST rewriting**: Each `.go` source file is parsed into a decorated syntax tree
   (Orchestrion uses [github.com/dave/dst](https://github.com/dave/dst)) and instrumentation is
   woven in at the AST level — *before* the compiler sees the file.
3. **Aspects/rules**: What gets instrumented is controlled by an aspects/rules system.
   For Orchestrion: `orchestrion.tool.go` (imports) and/or `orchestrion.yml` (aspects file).
4. **No runtime agent**: The instrumentation becomes part of the compiled binary. At runtime,
   the instrumented code calls the tracer SDK (dd-trace-go for Orchestrion, OTel SDK for otelc).

From golang/go#69887 (Orchestrion maintainer):
> "It uses -toolexec to intercept all invocations to go tool compile, re-writing all the .go files
> to add instrumentation everywhere possible. Orchestrion can in some ways be seen as a
> compile-time-woven Aspect-Oriented Programming (AoP) framework."

From the OTel blog on otelc:
> "hooks into the standard Go toolchain during the build (through its `-toolexec` mechanism) and
> injects OpenTelemetry instrumentation into your code, its dependencies, and the standard library
> as they are compiled."

## 3. The Goroutine-Local Storage Mechanism (Confirmed)

The Datadog integration bundle defines a compile-time aspect in `dd-trace-go/internal/orchestrion/gls.orchestrion.yml`. It adds `__dd_gls_v2 any` to `runtime.g`, injects typed `go:linkname` accessors, and clears the field in `runtime.goexit1`.

The location matters: dd-trace-go owns this tracer-specific context integration; Orchestrion or otelc supplies the rewriting engine that applies it. This is why the public example should keep the dd-trace-go path instead of relabeling it as an otelc file.

Variable `go:linkname` resolution remains fragile. When both sides are BSS symbols, selection can depend on load order; this caused a Go 1.22 to 1.23 break tracked in golang/go#72032.

## 4. What It Instruments

### otelc (OTel SIG) — current supported list

The v1.0.1 instrumentation rules include:

- `net/http`, gRPC, `database/sql`, gin, go-redis v9, MongoDB, and segmentio Kafka;
- OpenAI clients for v1, v2, and v3 import paths;
- Kubernetes client-go informer caches for the declared v0.34.x and v0.35.x ranges;
- standard `log`, `log/slog`, and Logrus records.

Anthropic support appears in newer documentation but is absent from the v1.0.1
rule tree, so the pinned zeroins catalog does not report it. HTTP and gRPC
integrations produce spans and metrics, Go runtime metrics are collected by
default, and the logging integrations emit records through the configured SDK.
The repository's release rule tree is the source of truth.

### DataDog/orchestrion + dd-trace-go v2 — confirmed list

Verified from `contrib/supported_integrations.md` in DataDog/dd-trace-go v2 repo:

**HTTP/Frameworks:**

- Gin, Gorilla Mux, chi, echo v4, Fiber, net/http

**RPC:**

- gRPC

**Databases:**

- database/sql, sqlx, MongoDB (mongo-driver v1+v2), Gorm v2
- Redis: go-redis v6-v9, redigo, rueidis, valkey-go
- Cassandra: gocql
- Memcache

**GraphQL:**

- graph-gophers, graphql-go, gqlgen

**Cloud / Infrastructure:**

- AWS SDK v1 (deprecated) + v2
- Kafka: confluent-kafka-go v1+v2, IBM/sarama (Shopify/sarama deprecated)
- Vault, Consul

**Kubernetes:**

- client-go

**Sources:** [S-O-06]

## 5. CI / Build Integration

Usage pattern for both tools is the same: prefix `go build` with the tool binary.

```bash
# otelc
otelc go build -o myapp .

# orchestrion
orchestrion go build .
```

This works with any Go build system that supports `GOFLAGS` or custom build commands. It does not
require `go generate`, build tags, or code changes in the project.

CI pipeline integration: set `GOTOOLCHAIN` or add the tool to `$PATH` and prefix the build command.

## 6. Version & Go Compatibility

| Tool | Current version | Go min version |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| DataDog/orchestrion | v1.11.0 (2026-06-25) | Verify from go.mod |
| otelc | v1.0.1 (2026-07-14) | **Go 1.25+** (confirmed from README badge) |

**otelc requires Go 1.25+** — confirmed from the README badge `Go-1.25%2B`.
This is a significant constraint for the talk: services on Go 1.23/1.24 cannot use otelc.
For those, OBI or Orchestrion (check its go.mod) are the alternatives.

**Maintenance:** Re-check each tool's supported Go versions before presenting; otelc currently requires Go 1.25+.

---

## 7. Orchestrion is Vendor-Agnostic

From the DataDog/orchestrion README (HEAD df04ed94b69e, 2026-07-06):
> "Orchestrion is a vendor-agnostic tool. By default, `orchestrion pin` enables Datadog's tracer
> integrations by importing `github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2` in `orchestrion.tool.go`, but other
> vendors (such as OpenTelemetry) may provide alternate integrations that can be used instead."

This is relevant for the talk: Orchestrion can wire in OTel SDK too — it's not locked to Datadog.

---

## 8. Fit With the Talk

**Talk angle**: otelc (OTel SIG) is the zero-touch compile-time story. Orchestrion is the
"inspiration / predecessor" that shows the same idea at production scale (Datadog uses it internally).

**Decision framework**:

- otelc → production-capable build-time instrumentation, requires a build through the `otelc` wrapper, and has no attached runtime agent
- Orchestrion → same mechanism, battle-tested, defaults to dd-trace-go, vendor-agnostic

**Relationship to the thesis**: The `-toolexec` mechanism is a *compile-time workaround* for Go
having no runtime hook point. The hack (go:linkname / g-struct) is the evidence that even compile-time
approaches must reach into Go internals to support goroutine-aware tracing.

## zeroins catalog pin

`otelc-aspect` v0.1.0 embeds the supported-library catalog reviewed for otelc
`v1.0.1`. Its immutable rule source is
<https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation/tree/v1.0.1/instrumentation>.
The catalog is intentionally offline and changes only in a new zeroins release.
